a bad aged face
he had added a bed
a cabbage bed had each hedge
he added beach baggage
abe had defaced caged beef
chad had beheaded a egghead
a dead bee had faded
each had acceded a beachhead
ahab gaffed a beef chef
a headache hagged a chef
look on in no opinion
i loom in noon
joni in no kimono
i join in on pool polo
oil no pimp in mink kimono
kill no lion no minion no kin
no onion in pink lollipop
mink oil in pink pill
million in qom
loop pool on moon ok

styx trusts us

rusty ruts try us

suzy trusts wussy russ
can one be calm and noble and good
like a nice looking child in peace
a gleam of a diamond necklace on a maid
napoleon managed a balance of alliance
and among all men he looked noble
beaming face holding back a amiable mood
on behalf of all he once begged
a feminine chief in old age
he killed a childlike dame on demand
holding a cloak and bending
an animal all alone and caged
old and incapable he lacked an opinion
i am fond of all men leading a long life
he had fine linen and no alcohol
he looked pale and done
he began dancing on behalf of anna
he had been coming and going
fond of an old man in decline
he glanced again and became engaged
hide me alone in an open place
mamma had a feeling in her neck
her neice found a cold policeman
go and kill a menacing foe
her look made him inclinded
like ice in a pineapple milk
daniel clapped and danced behind her
they subdued her faded features
it was true she crushed the hydra
she refused what they have added
the secretary had dry eyes
her face was her fathers
fate was gestured by a feather
that was what we fathers have
the daughter had a defect
her dress sat where she was
she had feared the wretched war
her shy face had fear
her cares were gathered there
treat her as a guest
she was served the best
after he had uttered
these faces that he watched
day after day he refused the guards
because they saw that he was a great
the average guests had red dresses
the greatest war there ever was
dead by the deserted street
weary by the weather he swayed
the actresses had behaved bad
weather had vexed the daughter
tears had stabbed the heart
her beauty was as severe as truth
