she refused what they have added
the secretary had dry eyes
her face was her fathers
fate was gestured by a feather
that was what we fathers have
the daughter had a defect
her dress sat where she was
she had feared the wretched war
her shy face had fear
her cares were gathered there
treat her as a guest
she was served the best
after he had uttered
these faces that he watched
day after day he refused the guards
because they saw that he was a great
the average guests had red dresses
the greatest war there ever was
dead by the deserted street
weary by the weather he swayed
the actresses had behaved bad
weather had vexed the daughter
tears had stabbed the heart
her beauty was as severe as truth
