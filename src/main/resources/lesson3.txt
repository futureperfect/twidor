can one be calm and noble and good
like a nice looking child in peace
a gleam of a diamond necklace on a maid
napoleon managed a balance of alliance
and among all men he looked noble
beaming face holding back a amiable mood
on behalf of all he once begged
a feminine chief in old age
he killed a childlike dame on demand
holding a cloak and bending
an animal all alone and caged
old and incapable he lacked an opinion
i am fond of all men leading a long life
he had fine linen and no alcohol
he looked pale and done
he began dancing on behalf of anna
he had been coming and going
fond of an old man in decline
he glanced again and became engaged
hide me alone in an open place
